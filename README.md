Context Switch Concept using CSS Perspective
--------------------------------------------

Does your app require switching context? Or do you want to make your menus more interesting? [Try a demo of this concept](https://kierate.github.io/css-perspective-context-switch/index.html) for a cool way of achieving this.

The demo is based on Jaromin Kavan's shot on dribbble (https://dribbble.com/shots/2279959-Socialbakers-Analytics-concept) and uses the attachment he provided there. Definately check it out and check out Jaromin's work (https://dribbble.com/ToshTak).

I am not animating all of the details that you can see on Jaromin's shot, but you get the general idea of how to implement this cool effect.

Usage
=====
In case you've not seen Jaromin's shot - click on the header and when the active app slides down click on either of the other apps to switch to it. Simples.
